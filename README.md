# ***COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker***<br><br>

## ***Software and Language***
Tableau Public 2023.2<br>
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18<br>

## ***Project Overview***
Use SQL to extract the necessary data and construct a dynamic Tableau dashboard to monitor vaccination status and trends.<br>

## ***Results***
Users can fine-tune data by specifying start and end dates, continents, and countries. Subsequently, within the defined timeframe, the dashboard will display an overview of the selected regions' total population and vaccination rates (including partial, full, and unvaccination rates). Additionally, the dashboard features a heatmap depicting the full vaccination rate, a stacked bar chart visualizing partial and full vaccination rates, and a scatter plot illustrating the correlation between the full vaccination rate and GDP.<br>
